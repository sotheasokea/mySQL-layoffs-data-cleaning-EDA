2. Which companies laid off 100% of their workforce?
3. What were the total layoffs by company, industry, and country?
4. What was the overall timeline of the layoffs (from the earliest to the latest date)?
5. How did layoffs trend by year and by month?
6. What was the rolling total of layoffs over time to observe cumulative trends?
7. Who were the top 5 companies with the most layoffs for each year in the dataset?

# How to run the code?
1. download the layoffs.csv file
2. run the scripts: DataCleaning_layoffs.sql will create a new clean table layoffs_staging2.csv ( layoffs_cleaned.csv )
3. execute the EDA_layoffs.sql on the layoffs_staging2.csv to get the exploration of the data
